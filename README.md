# Functionalities of CampusGuard
1. Campus Safety Dashboard (for Admin & Security Teams)
- Real-time monitoring of emergency alerts triggered by students (from mobile app or web).
- Heatmap of campus safety incidents (assaults, theft, accidents).
- Live integration with CCTV or IoT sensors (if available).
- Prioritization of alerts (red = urgent emergency, yellow = suspicious activity).
- Role-based access (campus police, student affairs, faculty advisors).

2. Smart Reporting & Case Management System
- Students can anonymously report suspicious behavior or unsafe conditions via web.
- Security staff can track case progress (from "reported" → "investigated" → "resolved").
- Analytics to identify recurring safety issues (e.g., poorly lit areas).
- Automatic escalation workflows (urgent cases go directly to campus police).

3. SafeRoute Planner
- Web-based map that shows the safest walking routes across campus (based on lighting, crowd density, past incident history).
- Integration with crowd-sourced student reports (“avoid this area, low lighting”).
- Estimated time of arrival and live tracking for a "friend watch" feature.

4. Emergency Resource Hub
- Centralized portal with all safety-related resources:
- Contact info for campus police, emergency hotlines, and health services.
- Safety guides, first aid steps, and self-defense tutorials.
- A chatbot for emergency FAQs (“What should I do if I feel followed?”).

5. Safety Buddy System (Web + Mobile Sync)
- Students can register for a “safety buddy” before late-night study sessions.
- Buddies get notified if the student doesn’t check in safely after a set time.
- Web portal for campus authorities to monitor buddy check-in compliance.

6. Crowdsourced Incident Reporting Map
- Students/staff can pin unsafe areas (e.g., “broken light pole,” “stray dogs,” “isolated alley”).
- Color-coded heatmap of reported risks, updated in real time.
- Admins can mark issues as resolved when fixed (like Waze for safety hazards).

7. AI-Powered Threat Detection Portal
- Upload or stream suspicious activity (e.g., from student phones or campus CCTV).
- AI model flags dangerous objects (weapons, fire, overcrowding).
- Auto-notifies nearest responders with incident details.
